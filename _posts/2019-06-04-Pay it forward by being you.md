# Pay it forward by being you
### Mayuko Inoue from Netflix @ altconf 2019

First of all, Mayuko Inoue, the speaker, is an amazing person - she has a great vision not only for the products she work with but also the contents and the people around her. You can find her on instagram or twitter [@hellomayuko](instagram.com/hellomayuko).

Her talk was mainly about how we can contribute to the next generation of developers, the people that are coming now to the field, and who will be here in the future.

But she had a very different way of thinking about this. The first step to do it was:

> **Figure out who you are**

But, why is that?

As technology changes fast, so does people. We need new ways to talk about technology, new ways to express ourselves about it and share it with other people. Knowing yourself is the first step to get to know what do you like inside the tech field, and with it, create your way to talk about it. So we get to our second point:

> **Show people who you are (What do you stand for?)**

She found a great way to express herself through her blog and youtube videos. She could share her experiences, what was being an iOS developer on her position, and communicate with the people around her,

While she talked a little bit about her trajectory, she said that she didn't think she was a good developer during her college - she was not the first in class, she didn't have much of experience on programming before going to college... But she wanted to express herself, and show to people what she could do.

On this part of the talk, she brought a very important thing, the **Impostor Syndrome**.

*What's that?*

It's basically a feeling that your are never enough to what you are doing, that your work is not enough and ultimately that *you* are not enough.

> Of course this is a simplification of the *Impostor Syndrome*, you can take a look into this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) to start learning more.

On technology, its very very common, you'll never be able to know all the tech, to know everything there is on the programming languages you work with, all the new patterns, all the new stuff... and that can make you feel bad about it.
*Is my work good enough?*

It's something we have to fight. Individually and in the workplaces.
First recognizing a good job, celebrating victories and moments. If you think someone made something nice, got a nice result, say that, recognize the person's work.
Of course, everything can improve, but this is the first step - value the people around you.

Once you create this environment, try losing the fear of trying new things, looking further away towards better solutions, and now of course, you'll have your colleagues to support you, and you to support them.

Now, we get to the third point:

> **80%**

Start what you are thinking you want to do. Don't let yourself stop you. Just put it out there!

*What are the 80%?*

That's what you'll need to put your work out there, do no target for the 100% because perfection cannot be measured. Make sure you have something that can be shared, work to improve it, but above the 80% its very difficult to measure because *what's the best is a different definition for each person.*.

In parallel to the speech about how to share things with the next generation of developers, she talked a little bit specifically about the iOS app developer community, and she was complemented by people on the audience too.

*How do people reach the iOS developer community?*

This is a difficult thing to do actually. Developing for iOS, MacOs, iPadOS (recently announced)... you'll need a Mac setup, and one of the first barriers is the price of the equipment.

Apple stuff are expensive.

So becoming a part of this community is quite a work by itself.

*But how can we help?*

In general, talk to people.
Meet the community of where you live, start something with them. Share knowledge. That's one of the best ways to create new contacts and make the developer community become bigger and do a better work everywhere.
