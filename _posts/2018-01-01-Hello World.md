Hi There!

I'm [Giovani Nascimento Pereira](fb.com/giovaninppc), and I'm a student at Unicamp Uniersity (Brazil), and former iOS Developer by Apple Developer Academy @ Instituto Eldorado Campinas.

Well, this is my first blog post, so I decided to keep the Hello World Title and talk a little bit about myself, and why I'm doing this.

Since I starte studying to become an iOS Developer, the need of having a site of my own was growing, I wanted to display everything I've done, and also I needed to host some information in order to make public an everything else.

The easiest sollution was using the [GitHub](github.com) pages!
(Thaks a lot for that GitHub ‚ù§Ô∏è)
So I could host an entire web site for free (I also recommend that if you want to have a site or anything, its really awesome)

And was another oportunity to study somethig new.

This website base was forked from [Jekyll Now](barryclark/jekyll-now), which is an Quick Start for sites in Jekyll, since GitHub.io supports jekyll.

If you have any doubt you can contacte me üòâ, and if your are really reading this, I hope you get to use or enjoy the other contents I post.

Thanks a lot!
